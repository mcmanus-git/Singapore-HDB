**Background**

* abc

* def 

* This `location <https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/3xm88g6m6d/2>`_ also has those above raw files (as the authors prefer to store here). Moderate corrections were posted to the above `here <https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/16/4650/htm>`_.  Original paper in html form is `here <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7218897/>`_. 

* Note:  Related but not used original UCI-level dataset can be found `here <Smartphone-Based Recognition of Human Activities and Postural Transitions Data Set>`_ 

* `Really good video of experiement in action <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOEN9W05_4A>`_

**Jupyter Notebooks**

* **Plot**:  Raw lat/long data files kept `here <https://github.com/tombresee/Michigan_Milestone_Initial_Work/blob/main/ENTER/RAW%20DATASET%20II/nodes.csv>`_.  The online arc gis like map from AoT is viewable `here <https://data.cityofchicago.org/Environment-Sustainable-Development/Array-of-Things-Locations-Map/2dng-xkng>`_, maybe we build our own version of this.  Should be easy to do, just taking lats/lons into some pretty picture.

* `Dataset 2 <https://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/waggle/downloads/datasets/index.php>`_ - We will use huge file 'AoT_Chicago.complete.latest.tar', where `this <https://github.com/waggle-sensor/waggle/blob/master/data/README.md>`_ explains how to unzip it 

Files:
::
    data.csv.gz	    # compressed file of all data values
    nodes.csv	    # list of nodes in the dataset and their metadata
    README.md	    # An explaination of the database fields 
    sensors.csv	    # A list of sensors and their metadata
    offsets.csv     # data.csv.gz file byte offsets
